# Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. t is by far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes. In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security, and flexibility in mind.


# Learning Git

I feel the best way to learn Git is to just use it. A good place to start out using Git is with the command line or terminal.

## .gitignore file

When working with a Git repository, you usually want to ignore files that are not directly related to the codebase. This keeps the Git repository clean and reduces clutter. Create a hidden file named ".gitignore".

    log/*.log # ignore log files
    tmp/ # ignore the temporary directory
    .DS_Store # ignore .DS_Store files on OS X

[GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore) has a collection of useful .gitignore templates.
